###A Ruby on Rails networking app.

Don't want to have lunch alone?

This web app invites two users to have lunch together.  The users are currently matched by their location and lunch time.  Future features include matching users by their interests as well.

The Yelp API and gem is used to randomly select a restaurant based on user preferences.
